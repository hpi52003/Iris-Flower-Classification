# Iris-Flower-Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their petal and sepal measurements. The classification is performed using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train machine learning models to classify iris species
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset**, which consists of 150 samples with the following attributes:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate classification results.

```

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
